# Pong
Pong game project made with Visual Studios (XNA) for PSY 30676 in Spring 2015

A midsemester project made for the Programming for Video Game Development course (PSY 30676) at the University of Notre Dame.
The project was written in C# and compiled with Visual Studios 2015, as well as the Microsoft XNA distributable.

This project is a recreation of the classic Pong game. Both single player (versus an AI) and player versus player can be played.
